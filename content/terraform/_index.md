You can join my [YouTube live streams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGH0yYPvlCN1VjSFMGVmFgQ) every Friday where I do live coding of https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules and other Terraform projects (writing only HCL and README). There is a [playlist of my previous episodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvz1V_9d3uis9mxZ8eATA6l9Sr1XLeY4Y).

Episodes marked as "hacking edition" are probably the best for HCL writers.
